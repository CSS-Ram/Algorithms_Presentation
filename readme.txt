                                                            ***Our Presentation***

We developed an initial solution for our problem statement and then refined it.
We are submitting the codes for both initial solution and refined solution in C language.

Compilation : 
Our code gets compiled by any gcc compiler. It also gets compiled by any IDE supporting C language.

Execution : 
The code takes some time to execute since there are a huge number of arithmetic operations.
Hence we set some maximum limits to the user input.
For initial solution, the maximum limit is set to 55.
For refined solution, the maximum limit is set to 200.
Whenever you try to execute the code with input values close to the limits, the code takes an amount of time to get executed and produce the output. For small numbers such as the test cases shown in the presentation, you can get output easily.

Warning : If the input is given to be large numbers, the output value beats the maximum int value of C and thus it overflows.
